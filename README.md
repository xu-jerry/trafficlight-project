# Traffic Light Project

Using the Bosch dataset, this is a machine learning project that will be able to identify whether a trafficlight in an image is red, green, yellow, or off. The Bosch dataset has test data from 24068 to 40734, evens, resulting in 8334 images.

## Example Images

## Difficulties

Many of the images were either occluded, off, or too small. For some, even a human eye would not be able to detect which color the light was.
