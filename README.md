# Traffic Light Project

Using the Bosch dataset, this is a machine learning project that will be able to identify whether a trafficlight in an image is red, green, yellow, or off. The Bosch dataset has test data from 24068 to 40734, evens, resulting in 8334 images.

Challenging case image, and data distribution

Many of the images were either occluded, off, or too small. For some, even a human eye would not be able to detect which color the light was.

## Convolutional Neural Network

Describe how CNN works and draw your model architecture. Briefly discuss why you choose the model.

## Training Process

decay learning rate

linear classifier
large learning rates
other hyperparameters

plot - training loss, validation loss

## Evaluation

Train, validation, and test accuracy
report the confusion matrix

## Further Discussion
Annotation issue
Simplied version (remove arrows, remove occluded case, remove tiny crops)
we need detector/tracker
